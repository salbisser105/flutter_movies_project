# flutter_movies_app

A new Flutter movies project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a movies application. This project is handled with GetX. 

The main focus of this project is to practice my skills.

There are some upgrades that could be done in order to improve the quality of the project, such as:
* Do the search function and make it work propperly. 
* Get the information from the cast. Using the API. 
* Look for opportunities to refactor and improve the code.
* Add more screens, more functionalities.
* Improve the UI.


Hope that this helps
